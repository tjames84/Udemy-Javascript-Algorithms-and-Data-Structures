Recursion :

1. Define what recursion is and how it can be used?

    - A process that calls itself
    - in javascript its a function that calls itself

    why do we need this?

    -- its everywhere!
    -- JSON.parse or JSON.stringify 
    -- document.getElementById and DOM traversal 
    -- Object traversal
    -- it will be seen in more complex data structures
    -- a cleaner alt to iteration

2. Understand the two essential components of recursive function.

    1. base case
        - where the recursion ends

    2. Different input
        - this is where recursion happens

3. Visualize the call stack to better debug and understand recursive functions.


4. use helper method recursion and pure recursion to solve more difficult problems.
